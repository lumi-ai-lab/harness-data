# QDM Harness Agent Instructions

Read `README.md` before running QDM data commands.

- Always run from the harness-data runtime workspace root.
- Use `source config/qdm-cli-paths.env` before invoking QDM data CLIs from shell snippets.
- Numeric values, rankings, comparisons, and thresholds must come from CLI output.
- Do not estimate missing values or replace missing data with examples.
- Deliver Harness analysis results, query results, reports, summaries, and diagnostic conclusions directly in the conversation by default.
- Do not write final results or intermediate analysis results to files unless the user explicitly asks to export, save, or generate a file.
- Do not read or use template files directly unless `bin/data-harness-cli inject-template` has been requested by the harness flow and the hook injects the template.
- Use only commands exposed by the installed `qdm-metric-cli --help` and its subcommand help.
- Do not call legacy data CLIs or run credential/token setup.
